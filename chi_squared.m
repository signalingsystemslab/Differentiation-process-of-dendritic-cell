function [chi2, chi2_old] = chi_squared(y,fit,P,eb)

% returns *reduced* chi^2 value for use in data modelling
% "y" is a vector of data, "fit" is a vector of model values (size(fit)=size(y)), P is the number of
% parameters fit in the model, and eb is a vector of error bars (1-to-1 correspondnce with y)
